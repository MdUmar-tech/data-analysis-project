## Description
This scripts involves the calculation of the Percentage of Conserved Proteins (POCP) using a Jupyter Notebook and python3 using Mac OS . POCP is a metric used in comparative genomics to measure the similarity between two microbial genomes.
Methods originaly described in Qin et al (2014) (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.01688-14)

## Jupyter Notebook
- The main calculation and analysis are performed in the Jupyter Notebook file named `calculate_pocp.ipynb`.
- Open the notebook in Jupyter to explore the code and see the results.

## Dependencies
- python 3

## Results
Briefly describe the results of the POCP calculation and any insights gained from the analysis.
